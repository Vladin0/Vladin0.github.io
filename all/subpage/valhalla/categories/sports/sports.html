      Rocket League is one of the best football games of all time. Yes, it replaces a team of 11 players with three rocket-powered cars, potentially adorned with a stack of pancakes or a sombrero, and it’s still an excellent football game. The FIFA and PES communities constantly bicker amongst themselves about scripted gameplay and pay to win mechanics; you won’t hear any of that about Rocket League. Psyonix has perfected the mechanics of Rocket League, allowing the game to be accessible to most people while maintaining an absurdly high skill ceiling. The esports scene for Rocket League shows just how much depth there is to a game about flying cars. Even better, Rocket League is free to play and features cross-platform play on every platform. If you have the slightest interest in hitting a massive ball with a flying car, give Rocket League a try.

      Golf With Your Friends is exactly what it sounds like – play with up to 11 friends as you make your way through themed mini golf courses. Turn on power ups to freeze your opponent’s ball, and lay down lanes of honey to stop players in their tracks. The game even comes with a built-in level editor for players who have a keen eye for golf courses. Golf With Your Friends can be played simultaneously online or locally via the hot seat option; perfect with Steam’s Remote Play feature. The best part about this game is that the barrier to entry doesn’t exist – no real life golf skills apply here; simply pick a direction, decide how hard to hit the ball, and pray for the best.

      The FIFA series has always been a staple of PC gaming ever since the 90s. Though there have been some awkward years between engine upgrades, EA has always stuck by their PC audience. FIFA 21 was far from the most innovative in terms of gameplay, but you know what they say, if it ain’t broke…
      FIFA has dominated the football scene ever since Ultimate Team was introduced to the masses with FIFA 11. The card game has completely changed sports games forever as players clamour around the latest additions to the game mode each week. Assembling your favourite players from the past and present is simply too tempting a prospect to ignore.

      If you’re primarily playing offline, NBA 2K22 is an excellent game with a lengthy MyCareer story mode for solo players to delve into. Not only do you have the entire selection of modern teams available to play, 2K22 offers players a number of classic teams throughout NBA history to pick from. Want to see how the 2021 Golden State Warriors stack up against the Chicago Bulls from ‘96? You can play match ups like this without having to spend any extra money. NBA 2K22 is the definitive basketball game on PC, and it’s also the only basketball series available right now. Almost every version of NBA 2K is filled with cheaters that the developers are struggling to squash; unfortunately, this makes online matches more frustrating than enjoyable.
